## 1. FISCAL IMPULSE ANALYSIS (DTS Data through Nov 21)

### Core Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target/Benchmark | Status |
|--------|---------|------------------|--------|
| **Weekly Impulse % GDP** | 0.51% | ~0.64% | ⚠️ **13bps BELOW** |
| **MA20 Daily Impulse** | $32.6B | ~$40B historical | Running light |
| **MTD Impulse (Nov)** | $432.3B | ~$500B typical | On pace |
| **Daily Impulse (Nov 21)** | $31.2B | ~$33B MA20 | Within range |

**Interpretation:**
- Federal spending is running ~20% below the "fiscal week" target of 0.64% GDP
- This suggests **fiscal drag** rather than stimulus entering Q4
- However, spending is **98% above YoY implied** ($31.2B vs $15.7B), indicating significant expansion vs 2024

### Time-Frame Analysis

**Month-to-Date (Nov 1 - Nov 21):**
- Total Impulse: **$432.3B**
- Avg Daily: **$20.6B**
- **Composition:**
  - HHS/Medicare: $100.2B (23%)
  - SSA Benefits: $89.6B (21%)
  - Interest on Debt: $77.7B (18%) ⚠️
  - VA Benefits: $7.2B (2%)

**Fiscal Year-to-Date (FY2026: Oct 1 - Nov 21):**
- FYTD Impulse: **$1,127.8B**
- **YoY Delta: +$92.4B (+8.9%)**
- Pace: ~$22B/day average

**Late-Month Dynamic (LTD):**
- Last 5 days show volatility: $97B spike on Nov 17 (likely debt service/month-end settlements)
- Current TGA balance: **$892B** (healthy but declining from $928B on Nov 18)

### Historical Comparison

| Comparison | Value | Interpretation |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| **YoY Delta (Daily)** | +$15.5B | **+98% vs LY** |
| **3-Year Baseline** | +$2.4B | **+7.9% vs 3Y avg** |
| **FYTD vs LY** | +$92.4B | **Expansion trend** |
| **Implied Daily** | $15.7B | Actual **+98% above implied** |

**Key Takeaway:** While running below the 0.64% target, spending is materially elevated vs historical patterns. The gap vs target reflects GDP growth rather than fiscal contraction.

---

## 2. HOUSEHOLD ABSORPTION & COMPOSITION

### Household-Directed Spending (Nov 21)
- **Household Impulse:** $18.3B/day
- **Share of Total:** 58.7%
- **Breakdown:**
  - Social Security: Largest component (~$89.6B MTD)
  - Medicare/HHS: Second largest (~$100.2B MTD includes transfers)
  - VA Benefits: $7.2B MTD
  - Unemployment: $2.2B MTD (low, reflects strong labor market)
  - Tax Refunds: $0 (off-season)

**Analysis:**
- Household absorption at 58.7% is **elevated** (typical range: 50-55%)
- This reflects **transfer payment dominance** in fiscal impulse
- Interest payments at $77.7B (18% of MTD) are **structural drag** - this money goes to bondholders, not broad economy
- Corporate/Business directed spending is **minority** at ~40%

**Liquidity Impact:**
- High household share suggests **broad-based liquidity distribution**
- However, 18% going to interest is **non-productive** fiscal impulse

---

## 3. TREASURY LIQUIDITY (TGA Balance)

### Current Status
- **TGA Balance:** $892B (Nov 21)
- **MTD Change:** -$36B (peak: $928B on Nov 18)
- **Trend:** Declining post-debt ceiling refill

**Context:**
- TGA at $892B is **healthy** (typical range: $400-900B)
- Recent drawdown suggests **tax receipts lighter** than spending
- No immediate cash concerns for Treasury operations

**Monthly Pattern:**
- Nov 17 spike ($97.6B daily impulse) likely month-end settlement
- TGA volatility reflects **timing of debt auctions** vs spending

---

## 4. FED LIQUIDITY MONITOR (Nov 25)

### Net Liquidity (Calculated without TGA)
⚠️ **Note:** TGA data not merged in Fed analysis - net liquidity calculation incomplete

### RRP Facility - CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Current RRP Balance** | $1.08B | 🔴 **HISTORIC LOW** |
| **MTD Change** | -$51B (-97.9%) | Accelerating drain |
| **QTD Change** | -$9B (-89.4%) | Near exhaustion |
| **3M Avg** | $14B | Current 93% below avg |
| **RRP Percentile (3M)** | 2nd percentile | Extreme low |

**Interpretation:**
- RRP collapsing from **$330B (Q4 2024) → $1B** = **99.7% decline**
- This represents **$329B liquidity returning to financial system**
- Banks no longer parking cash at Fed = **system liquidity improving**
- **Forecast (5-day):** -$1B (trend to zero)

**Market Implications:**
- RRP drain = **liquidity EASING** (counteracts QT)
- Money market funds reallocating to **T-bills, repo, credit**
- SOFR-IORB spread at +3bps shows **no stress** despite RRP collapse

### Balance Sheet & QT Pace

| Metric | Value | YoY | Annualized Pace |
|--------|-------|-----|-----------------|
| **Total Assets** | $6,555B | -$204B (-3.0%) | -$143B/year |
| **Treasury Holdings** | $4,191B | - | Runoff |
| **MBS Holdings** | - | - | Passive runoff |
| **Bills (QE indicator)** | $195B | - | Minimal purchases |
| **Coupons (Runoff)** | $3,995B | - | Primary QT vector |

**QT Analysis:**
- Annualized pace: **-$143B** (vs -$1T+ target earlier in year)
- **QT is SLOWING** materially
- Fed may be approaching **terminal balance sheet** size
- Weekly change: **$0** (last 5 days) - suggests runoff pause or deceleration

## 5. MONEY MARKET STRESS INDICATORS

### Spreads & Rates (Nov 25)
| Rate | Level | Spread vs IORB | Status |
|------|-------|----------------|--------|
| **IORB (Floor)** | 3.90% | - | Policy anchor |
| **SOFR** | 3.93% | +3bps | ✅ Normal |
| **EFFR** | 3.88% | -2bps | ✅ Below floor (expected) |
| **TGCR** | 3.90% | 0bps | ✅ At floor |

**Spread Analysis:**
- **SOFR-IORB: +3bps** - Well within normal range (0-5bps)
- MTD avg: **7.32bps** (includes Oct 31 spike at 32bps)
- QTD volatility: **7.86bps std dev** (moderate)
- 3M avg: **6.13bps** (benign)

### Spike Detection
- **Current Status:** ✅ NORMAL
- **Spike Count MTD:** 25 (likely Oct 31 quarter-end effect in data)
- **Max Spike (3M):** 32bps on Oct 31 (quarter-end)
- **Spike Threshold:** 9.31bps (MA20 + 2σ)

**Interpretation:**
- No structural stress in money markets
- Oct 31 spike = **technical quarter-end** (window dressing)
- Current +3bps = **healthy collateral availability**

### Composite Stress Index
- **Score:** 0/100 (LOW)
- **Level:** LOW STRESS
- **Components:**
  - SOFR Spread: 100/100 (wide but not stress)
  - EFFR Spread: -1333/100 (calculation anomaly - negative spread)
  - Volatility: 0/100 (calm)
  - RRP Usage: 71/100 (low usage = liquidity abundant)
  - Repo Usage: 0/100 (no SRF usage = no stress)

## 6. TREASURY CURVE & INFLATION EXPECTATIONS

### Curve (Nov 25)
| Maturity | Yield | Change (5D) | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **2Y** | 3.51% | - | Policy expectations |
| **5Y** | 3.62% | - | Terminal rate view |
| **10Y** | 4.06% | - | Growth + premium |
| **30Y** | 4.71% | - | Term premium |

**Curve Shape:**
- **2s10s:** +55bps (steepening) ⬆️
- **5s30s:** +109bps (normal) ⬆️
- **Interpretation:** Market pricing **growth + inflation** at long end, **Fed cuts** at short end

### Breakeven Inflation
- **10Y Breakeven:** 2.23% (stable, above Fed target)
- **5Y Breakeven:** 2.30% (slightly elevated)
- **10Y-5Y Spread:** -7bps (expecting moderation)

**Context with Today's PPI:**
- PPI at -0.1% MoM = **deflation** in producer prices
- Retail sales +0.6% = strong **final demand** despite producer deflation
- **Margin expansion environment** for corporates
- Breakevens at 2.23-2.30% suggest market **unconvinced** deflation is structural

---

## 7. REGIME DETECTION & POLICY STANCE

### Current Regime
- **Classification:** 📉 **QT** (Quantitative Tightening)
- **Confidence:** 100%
- **Signals:** Balance sheet declining, no new purchases

### Policy Dynamics
**Fed:**
- QT pace: -$143B/year (moderating)
- RRP unwinding: **Offsetting QT** via +$329B liquidity injection
- **Net effect:** System liquidity **IMPROVING** despite QT

**Treasury:**
- Fiscal impulse: +$92B YoY (expansionary)
- Running 0.51% GDP (below target but positive)
- **Net effect:** Modest fiscal support

**Combined:**
- **Liquidity environment:** NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY ACCOMMODATIVE
- RRP unwind + fiscal expansion > QT drag
- This explains **risk asset resilience** + low money market stress

---

## 8. CORRELATIONS & CROSS-MARKET DYNAMICS (3M)

| Pair | Correlation | Interpretation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **RRP vs SOFR-IORB** | +0.37 | Declining RRP = wider spreads (collateral rebalance) |
| **Fed Assets vs Breakeven** | +0.73 | **High correlation** - QT tempering inflation expectations |

**Key Insight:** Fed balance sheet contraction is **working** to anchor inflation expectations (+0.73 correlation). However, RRP collapse is **partially offsetting** this via liquidity injection.

---

## 9. FORECAST & OUTLOOK (5-Day)

### RRP Forecast
- **Current:** $1.08B
- **5-Day Forecast:** -$1B (trend to $0.08B)
- **Trend:** ↓ Declining
- **Confidence (R²):** 0.47 (moderate)
- **Interpretation:** RRP facility approaching **functional zero**

### Implications
1. **Money market dynamics shift:** Once RRP hits zero, next marginal liquidity must find home in:
   - T-bills (yields may compress)
   - Repo market (SOFR-IORB may widen)
   - Credit markets (spread tightening)

2. **Fed response:** May need to **slow QT** further to avoid reverse repo going negative (banks would be borrowing, not lending)

3. **Fiscal timing:** If TGA continues declining (tax season not until April), Treasury will need to **issue more bills** → potential T-bill supply pressure

---

## 10. TRADING IMPLICATIONS & RISK ASSESSMENT

### Immediate (1-5 Days)
**Bullish Factors:**
- PPI deflation + strong retail sales = **margin expansion**
- RRP → T-bill rotation continues = **bill yield compression**
- Consumer confidence stable = **demand holds up**

**Bearish Factors:**
- Fiscal impulse below target = **less support**
- Interest payments 18% of spending = **fiscal inefficiency**
- RRP near zero = **regime change** in money markets

**Recommendation:** NEUTRAL. PPI data removes inflation concerns, but fiscal impulse running light limits upside.

### Medium Term (1-3 Months)
**Watch For:**
1. **RRP hitting zero** - Will Fed respond by slowing QT?
2. **TGA drawdown** - If continues, Treasury must issue more (supply pressure)
3. **Year-end effects** - December spending surge typical (budget year-end)
4. **FOMC reaction function** - Will slowing inflation → more cuts?

**Base Case:**
- Fed continues QT at reduced pace (-$100-150B/year)
- Fiscal spending accelerates into December (typical pattern)
- Money markets remain stable through RRP exhaustion

### Risk Scenarios

**Upside Scenario (30% prob):**
- Deflation trend continues → Fed cuts aggressively
- Fiscal spending surges in December (year-end budget flush)
- RRP unwind → credit spread tightening
- **Target:** 10Y yield to 3.80%, risk assets +5-8%

**Base Case (50% prob):**
- Current trends persist
- Fed holds policy steady
- Markets range-bound
- **Target:** 10Y yield 3.95-4.15% range

**Downside Scenario (20% prob):**
- RRP exhaustion causes money market disruption
- TGA decline → large bill issuance surge
- Fiscal impulse weakens further
- **Target:** 10Y yield to 4.30%, risk assets -3-5%

## 12. SUMMARY: WHAT MATTERS NOW

### Top 3 Takeaways:
1. **RRP Collapse is the story** - $330B → $1B represents massive liquidity injection offsetting QT
2. **Fiscal impulse running light** - 0.51% vs 0.64% target, but still +98% YoY (mixed signal)
3. **No money market stress** - Despite RRP exhaustion, spreads remain benign (system handling well)

### Key Monitoring Points:
- **Daily:** SOFR-IORB spread (watch for widening beyond 5bps)
- **Weekly:** RRP balance (will it go to literal zero or stabilize?)
- **Monthly:** TGA trajectory (determines bill issuance needs)

### Strategic Positioning:
- **Rates:** Neutral. Curve fairly priced at 2s10s +55bps.
- **Credit:** Constructive. RRP unwind = spread tightening.
- **Equities:** Neutral-Bullish. Deflation + strong consumer = margins, but fiscal support fading.
- **USD:** Neutral. Fed QT moderating, but fiscal not surging.
